# metal-cpp-example
Just a C++ port of Apple's Metal API [official example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/basic_tasks_and_concepts/performing_calculations_on_a_gpu?preferredLanguage=occ).  

Since the Metal C++ API is rather new, there aren't many 
examples on the internet that demonstrate explicit usage 
usage of the C++ parts. This code can serve as a reference
if you plan to use the C++ API specifically.
